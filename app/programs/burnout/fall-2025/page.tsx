            Welcome to the Fall 2025 cohort of APP's Burnout Support
            Program!{" "}
          </b>
          We're very grateful that you're joining us and that we're on this
          learning and healing journey together.
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost: This program is designed to meet you where you
          are. It consists of{" "}
          <b>
            professionally guided peer support: 3 cohort meetups and 5
            discussion topics
          </b>{" "}
          sent via email to 1:1 pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything is spaced out to provide ample time to connect and process;
          the last thing we want to do is put too much onto your overflowing
          plate. Here are some baseline expectations as a participant:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc mx-4 max-w-xl">
          <li>
            All <b>cohort meetups are optional</b> (but we do hope you attend!)
          </li>
          <li>
            We don't expect pairs to be constantly available for one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do expect <b>pairs to touch base at least 5 times</b> over the 8
            week program: once per discussion topic.

        <h2 className="mt-8 font-medium">What's my 1:1 match?</h2>
        <p>
          If you've indicated on the signup form that you want a match, you will
          be matched with another person in the cohort for private peer support.
          They're <b>your buddy in the program</b>: you'll receive the
          discussion topics and online resources to talk about with them. You
          both have so much to learn from one another, especially with expert
          guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are matched based on factors like: your stage of burnout, your
          location in Amsterdam, how many kids you have, and how old they are.
        </p>
        <p className="italic max-w-xl">
          If your match isn't a good fit, please email us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:amsterdamparentproject@gmail.com">
            amsterdamparentproject@gmail.com
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-8 font-medium">What are discussion topics?</h2>
        <p>
          There are 5 discussion topics sent to each of the cohort pairs{" "}
          <b>via email</b> over the course of the program. These are designed to{" "}
          <b>help you connect with your match</b> for peer support. They
          facilitate guided conversation on an area of burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the discussion prompt, you'll also get a related
          resource on an aspect of burnout. It's optional reading, but it may
          also serve as a great topic to discuss with your match.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-8 font-medium">What are cohort meetups?</h2>
        <p>
          There are 3 cohort meetups scheduled during the 8 week program: 2
          online and 1 in person in Amsterdam. It's a chance for all of us come
          together to learn about and hear{" "}
          <b>different perspectives on overarching burnout topics</b>, like
          juggling your career while burnt out; developing burnout-busting daily
          routines; managing relationships, and more.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Each of the meetups will be led by one of the facilitators: the online
          meetups by Miriam (our psychotherapist) and the in-person meetup by
          Alex (who has personal experience with burnout). The location of the
          in-person meetup is TBD, but will be in Amsterdam.
