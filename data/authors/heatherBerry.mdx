I am a Postpartum Support Specialist with a background in Postpartum Nursing, and Professionally Certified Coaching. With over 15 years of experience, I’ve supported hundreds of women through the challenges of the postpartum period, offering both clinical expertise and compassionate care.

Becoming a mother myself to three wonderful children—two sons and a daughter—has been my greatest blessing and the most transformative experience of my life. Like many mothers, I faced my own struggles during this journey, and it was through these personal challenges that I truly understood the value of comprehensive support during this life-changing transition.

Drawing on my background in postpartum nursing, transitional coaching, and my own experience as an expatriate mother, I founded BerryCare & Coaching in Amsterdam in 2022, a service dedicated to supporting new and expat parents through the physical, emotional, and social challenges of parenthood. I am deeply committed to guiding parents as they adjust to the many roles and changes that parenthood brings.
