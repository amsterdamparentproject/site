I’m an expat mama and technologist in Amsterdam West, with a passion for community building that has underscored my entire life and career. Whether serving on the board of a Dutch nonprofit to help women enter, stay, and grow in tech or packing friends into too-small city apartments, I have found purpose in bringing people together for meaningful connection and growth. When I moved to Amsterdam in 2020 — mid-pandemic — I experienced firsthand the challenges of starting a community from scratch in a foreign country. I knew that when I became a parent in 2023, I’d be facing those challenges all over again.

For expat parents, community is especially important; numerous studies show that immigrant parents suffer from postnatal depression at a greater rate than local parents, in part due to lack of social support. It’s hard enough to grapple with all of the monumental emotional, physical, and social changes that come with new parenthood — but then to add on an unfamiliar language, culture, and system? With fewer family members and friends around to help? It’s no wonder that expats face an uphill battle when parenting.

With the Amsterdam Parent Project, I want to build community around peer-to-peer support, (em)powered by professionals. We have so much to learn from one another, so much empathy to share, and many free hands to hold your baby so that you can take that one moment of rest. My goal is to create a place where folks can share the full load of parenthood, because it’s a heavy burden to bear on your own.
