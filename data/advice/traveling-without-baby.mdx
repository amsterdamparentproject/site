# Our answer

First off - take a deep breath. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about leaving your little one, but rest assured—babies are more adaptable than we give them credit for! With a little preparation, you can make this transition as smooth as possible for both of you.

> "The most important things are how you react to your baby after separation, whether the baby is left with a caring caregiver that they are familiar with and if they know you’re coming back," says psychotherapist Dr. Irena (Miriam) Domachowska.

We asked psychotherapist and APP co-founder Dr. Irena Domachowska how parents can best prepare for time away. She said, “Short-term separations with a sensitive caregiver do not have adverse effects on babies. Basically, the most important things are – how you react to your baby after separation, whether the baby is left with a caring caregiver that they are familiar with, and if they’ve experienced separation before and know you’re coming back.”

Tips for preparing your baby for separation:

1. **Choose a Familiar Caregiver** – Make baby stays with someone they know and trust, like another family member. A familiar face helps them maintain a sense of security.
2. **Ease Them into It** – If possible before the trip, practice leaving them with the caretaker for shorter periods of time.
3. **Stick to Their Routine** – Provide detailed instructions on sleep, feeding, and comfort habits to keep their schedule as consistent as possible.
4. **Leave Behind a Comfort Item** – A shirt that smells like you or a favorite stuffed animal can be soothing in your absence.
5. **Set a Calm tone** – Remember, children pick up on the mood around them. If you appear confident and calm when you’re saying goodbye or reuniting, your baby will feel reassured.

And finally: allow yourself the space to enjoy your travels. Remember, taking time for yourself isn’t just ok – it’s essential. A well-rested, recharged parent is the best gift you can give your baby.
