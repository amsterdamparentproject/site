We’re thrilled to introduce our new segment: Community Spotlight. The people we have around us play such a vital role in our experiences as parents, particularly as expats, and we want to shed some light on some of the faces in our world. Below, Claudia Dader shares some of the things she’s learned in her first six months of being a mom.

- **Name:** Claudia Dader
- **Originally from:** Spain
- **Age and gender of your child:** Boy, 6 months
- **What surprised you most about becoming a mom?** _There are so many things. It’s the calming power you have over your child, more than any other person, and the energy you still have during the day, even if you haven’t slept or had a single coffee. Our bodies are amazing, especially our breasts. It’s incredible how they work, and how little we know about them before we become mums._

> There’s a point where you think you aren’t going to make it but suddenly everything changes.

## What was your most recent parenting win?

_Taking him to daycare and being relaxed about it! At the beginning he didn’t want to drink from the bottle. It took us a few days of training at home, but finally he got used to it._

_There’s a point where you think you aren’t going to make it but suddenly everything changes. Same with sleep – he got used to taking his naps outside while walking, and I thought we were not gonna be able to get him to sleep at home on his crib. It’s a matter of wanting it to happen and patience. You need lots of patience._

## What’s been easier about having a kid than you thought it would be?

_Being able to travel, to take him with me anywhere. Being able to socialize, to sit at a restaurant with him and enjoy the food. Also, breastfeeding in public._

## What’s been more challenging?

_Probably pumping. I started when he was 5 months old and thought it was the hardest and tedious part of being a mum._

_It all changed when I tried a different pump, and got advice from other mums. It’s still not the most fun to do but you learn how to work with it._

## What have you been surprised to learn about your kid?

_That he likes everyone – he’s just as social as we are!_

## What’s the last kid-related thing you've looked up on Google?

_Can I add a bit of cinnamon to my baby’s porridge?_

## “I’m now an ‘armchair expert’ in…

_Cleaning baby noses!_

## What do you love about having a kid in the Netherlands?

_The lack of traffic compared to where we come from in Spain has made my morning walks with him very peaceful. I really enjoy the silence in the parks._

_I am really surprised by how well the system works with the Consultatiebureau. There is always one in your neighborhood, they have open walk-in days where you can just bring your child and get any questions answered, or measure him. The nurse also came to our house to explain us what they offer and give info about his next vaccinations._

## What's the biggest difference from having a kid in your home country?

_Daycare! Here you pay a fortune, while in my country it’s free. I wish it were different here._

## What’s your best piece of advice for parents-to-be or new parents?

_Start gathering information before you have your kid. Surround yourself with other mums and ask them lots of questions._

_Also, when you go back to work, try to have a few weeks where you only work one or two days for a gradual, smooth transition._
