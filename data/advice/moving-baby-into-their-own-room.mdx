Room sharing can be a wonderful way of bonding with your babe – not to mention, it’s [recommended](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/1/e2022057990/188304/Sleep-Related-Infant-Deaths-Updated-2022) by the AAP as a way to reduce the risk of SIDS. But **once the crucial six-month mark has passed, you might find yourself longing to reclaim your bedroom**. We asked sleep consultant Joanne Lozman to weigh in on how you can make the move while minimizing the impact on your family.

# Joanne's answer

As a children’s sleep coach, I am asked this question a lot. The decision is personal, and there is no “one-size-fits-all” answer, but understanding the factors involved can help you make the best choice for both you and your baby.

### Signs your baby might be ready for their own room

There is no fixed time that you should be sharing a bedroom with your baby. I would advise doing what works for your family. Here are a few signs that it might be time to transition your baby to their own room:

1. **Baby is sleeping longer stretches**: If your baby is sleeping through the night or taking longer naps, it might be a good indication that they can handle being in their own room without needing frequent nighttime check-ins.
2. **You’re both getting enough rest**: If you find that you’re both getting enough sleep with minimal disruptions when room-sharing, you might be ready for the change. However, if you or your baby are still waking up frequently during the night, it could be beneficial to wait a little longer.
3. **Your baby outgrows their bassinet/co-sleeper**: Once baby is rolling and moving around more during their sleep the bassinet/co-sleeper often becomes too small for them. If your baby is in a bassinet beside your bed, transitioning to a crib in their own room might be the next logical step.
4. **Baby starts standing in their crib**: I find that between 7-9 months room sharing can stop working as well. That is often because baby is becoming a lot more mobile. They can stand in their crib and see you! This can prompt some long wakings in the night.
5. **Baby is waking earlier in the morning**: As baby gets older they become more aware of noises. You may be a quiet sleeper but if you’re rustling the covers this could be enough to wake baby up from a light sleep. Moving them to their own room where it is quieter can help.

### What to expect during the transition

The shift from room-sharing to your baby sleeping in their own room can come with some challenges, depending on when you choose to make this move. It’s important to approach the transition with patience and flexibility. Here are a few tips to make the process smoother:

- **Take it slow**: You don’t have to make an immediate change. Consider starting with naps in the crib in their room during the day to help your baby get used to the new space.
- **Establish a bedtime routine**: A consistent routine in your baby’s new room helps your baby feel secure in their new space. After their bath, I would take them into their bedroom to read books, sing bedtime songs or any calming activities that signal to your baby that it’s time to sleep. Use a dim (warm colored) light in the room for the bedtime routine as this helps with their melatonin production.
- **Keep the room safe and comfortable**: Ensure the crib meets all safety standards, the room is not too hot or cold, and there are no choking hazards. Babies under 12 months should have an empty crib (no bumpers, blankets, pillows or toys). Keep the room dark. If you use a white noise machine, make sure it is not next to baby – try putting it next to the door or wall where the most noise comes from.
- **Trust your instincts**: Every baby is different. If your baby shows signs of distress or isn’t adjusting well, don’t hesitate to bring them back to your room for a little while longer. There’s no harm in waiting until both you and your baby are ready.

### Final thoughts

Deciding when your baby can sleep in their own room is a personal decision that depends on your baby’s development and your family’s needs. The most important thing is ensuring that both your baby and you are comfortable with the transition. Whether it’s at six months or a bit later, trust your instincts, make adjustments as necessary, and know that you’ll find the right time for your family.
