# Interview

> "Don't be ashamed to ask for advice and help from your network. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and in the city you have to create your own village."

## What was your most recent parenting win?

_Teaching our daughter how to choose her own clothes in the morning. (Between two options, but still!) And in general that I let my daughter explore as much as she wants. She really enjoys that._

## What‚Äôs been easier about having a kid than you thought it would be?

_How easy it ultimately is to keep a baby alive and happy. It is a lot of work, but every single task is actually very doable if you think about it. Oh, and dealing with the messier things of having a child is much less gross than I thought it would be._

## What‚Äôs been more challenging?

_I always thought that I was a person who didn't need a lot of sleep. I completely underestimated what prolonged sleep deprivation does to your brain._

## What has being a parent taught you about yourself?

_It doesn't matter how tired and frustrated I feel, there is always a way to take a deep breath, put on a smile and carry on._

## What have you been surprised to learn about your kid?

_That she is absolutely fearless. She wants to constantly explore and easily gets bored if she stays in the same space too long. She also eagerly engages with other parents and constantly tries to steal toys from other kids, even if they are a lot bigger..._

## What‚Äôs the last kid-related thing you've looked up on Google or asked AI about?

_Definitely recipes. Always more recipes_ üòù

## I‚Äôm now an ‚Äòarmchair expert‚Äô in‚Ä¶

_All the best places to take an active toddler to in Amsterdam_

## What do you love about having a kid in the Netherlands?

_How safe it feels, both in terms of traffic but also when going to a playground. I never have an unsafe feeling with the people that are there with me, and the comparably manageable traffic allows my daughter to explore much more than she would otherwise._

## What‚Äôs your best piece of advice for parents-to-be or new parents?

_Don't be afraid, you got this! And don't be ashamed to ask for advice and help from your network. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and in the city you have to create your own village._
