# I have a lot of holiday events coming up that clash with naptimes and bedtimes. How do I manage my baby’s routine through it all? I’m worried she’ll get overstimulated and overtired.

# Our answer

If your baby doesn’t do well when they miss out on rest — and whose baby does — it makes sense that you're daunted by the holiday season. Even with the best intentions from family and friends, it's hard to accommodate the strict routine of a baby.

To prepare yourself and those around you, think of what happens when your baby gets overstimulated or overtired. It might involve some extra crying, fussing, refusing food, and skipping sleep. The real question is: **How much of that are you ready to take on?**

> What’s **good for you** is almost always **good for your baby**.

“Here’s the truth,” says postpartum nurse Heather Berry of Berry Care and Coaching. “What’s good for you is almost always good for your baby. Is the joy of catching up with family and friends, sharing a laugh, and getting a well-deserved break worth dealing with a grumpy baby later on? If so, go ahead and enjoy the event! See how your baby does, and don’t forget to check in on how you’re doing, too.” As with so many parenting things, it’s all about **finding a balance between your needs and theirs**. Too much holiday spirit — and lack of good rest — isn’t good for anyone.

In case you're worried that a break from routine will have permanent effects on your baby's development: don't fear. Heather assures us that a few off days (or even weeks) won’t ruin your baby’s sleep forever. “They’re **more resilient than we give them credit for** — and so are you.”

So if you decide to toss the schedule in exchange for some merriment, know that you’re giving them the gift of holiday memories — and maybe a tiny bit of holiday chaos. Happy holidays, and good luck!
