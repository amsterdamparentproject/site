I am a psychologist (PhD) and a psychotherapist with 10 years of clinical experience. Throughout my career, I have been deeply fascinated by the profound impact of motherhood on women's psychological development, particularly in how it catalyzes the awakening of their deeper selves. This professional interest has been complemented and enriched by my personal journey into motherhood.

My own experience of becoming a mother has been transformative, to say the least. It overwhelmed me with a spectrum of raw, intense emotions and presented me with challenges that, at first, seemed insurmountable. The sleepless nights, the breastfeeding struggles, the balancing act between professional and personal life - all of these pushed me to my limits. However, as I navigated through these challenges, I discovered reserves of strength I didn't know I possessed.

This personal transformation has given me not only strength but also invaluable insights and a unique perspective that I bring to my professional practice. The empathy I've developed through my own struggles allows me to connect more deeply with my clients, especially those grappling with the complexities of motherhood. It has reinforced my belief in the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for growth even in the face of overwhelming circumstances.
