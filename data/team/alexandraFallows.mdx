I’m an Amsterdam-based senior copywriter and creative strategist. I’ve worked in many fields, from fashion and beauty to sustainability and tech, but my main passion has always been building community, collecting stories and sharing them with the world. I’m always amazed by the powerful lessons that come out when people come together and share their knowledge.

I had always known that having your people around you was important, but when I gave birth to my daughter, the vital role that community plays in parenting became even more clear to me. As an expat, my go-to people are often several time zones away. Great for middle of the night wisdom, a little less helpful for face-to-face moments of connection. This is where I learned to lean heavily on the local parent community. I felt privileged to connect with my new peers and learn the lessons they’re passing on. Empowered by the people around me, big scary topics like sleep, solids, and keeping my sanity during the long nights suddenly felt a lot less daunting.

By helping out with the Amsterdam Parent Project, I’m excited to help parents raise their voices to share their own stories. I’m looking forward to taking on the questions that wake all of us up at 3 a.m. – Is my kid breathing funny? Am I doing right by them? Did they eat enough today? – and help bring some peace of mind. All powered by our panel of experts. By building and sharing, we’re creating a stronger foundation for ourselves as parents and for our children.
