# Our answer

How exciting is it to share your new baby with all of the people in your life over the holidays! Of course, everyone is eager to attend your little one’s big debut. But for every well-intentioned friend or family member showering you with love and gifts, they may also be bringing along an unexpected present: **new germs** 😱 We asked postpartum nurse Heather Berry, from Berry Care and Coaching, to weigh in and help us navigate this tricky health (and social!) situation.

While we as **adults have fully developed immune systems** ready to tackle all the old and new germs that come our way, newborns don’t have that kind of protection yet. Your baby has some antibodies from you — especially if you’re breastfeeding — but **their immune system is still a work in progress**. If they do end up catching something, they can have a much harder time fighting it off and getting healthy again. And you don’t want a sick baby over the holidays!

> When someone is _desperate_ to smooch those precious little cheeks, you can gently explain that right now, your baby’s **‘approved kissing zone’ is their adorable little feet**.

When someone new kisses your baby’s cheek, there’s a **higher chance of them transmitting those new germs to your baby**. Instead, deflect your family and friends to your baby’s feet. “When someone is _desperate_ to smooch those precious little cheeks, you can gently explain that right now, your baby’s **‘approved kissing zone’ is their adorable little feet,”** says Heather. That way, everyone’s germs stay far away from your newborn’s face and hands.

Heather also has the following tip for eager visitors: “Until your baby’s immune system has had a chance to get stronger — and until they’re vaccinated — it’s a good idea for people to **wash their hands before holding your baby**.” It’s better to keep germs at arm’s length… or foot’s length, in this case.

You’re not denying family and friends the chance to show love; you’re **just helping keep your little one safe and healthy** for their introduction to the world. And don’t worry — the cheeks will still be there for future kisses!
